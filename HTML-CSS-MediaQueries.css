/* A media query in CSS is a CSS3 feature that allows you to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the user's device, such as screen size, screen resolution, and screen density. 

The condition can be a range of values for different characteristics of the device, such as:

min-width: styles will be applied when the width of the viewport is greater than or equal to a specific value.
max-width: styles will be applied when the width of the viewport is less than or equal to a specific value.
min-height: styles will be applied when the height of the viewport is greater than or equal to a specific value.
max-height: styles will be applied when the height of the viewport is less than or equal to a specific value.
min-resolution: styles will be applied when the resolution of the device is greater than or equal to a specific value.
max-resolution: styles will be applied when the resolution of the device is less than or equal to a specific value.
orientation: styles will be applied when the device is in a specific orientation (landscape or portrait). */



/* Basic layout styles */
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    font-size: 16px;
    line-height: 1.5;
}

/* Default styles for header */
header {
    background-color: #333;
    color: #f5f5f5;
    padding: 1em;
    text-align: center;
}

/* Default styles for section */
section {
    padding: 1em;
}

/* Default styles for footer */
footer {
    background-color: #f5f5f5;
    padding: 1em;
    text-align: center;
}
/* 
The media query @media (max-width: 600px) is used to apply styles for screens that have a maximum width of 600 pixels. Inside the media query, the styles for the <header>, <section>, and <footer> elements are overridden to adjust for smaller screens.

For example, the background color of the header changes from #333 to #ff0000 and the padding for the section and footer decreases from 1em to 0.5em. */

/* Media query for screens smaller than 600px */
@media (max-width: 600px) {
    /* Styles for header on small screens */
    header {
        background-color: #ff0000;
        color: #333;
    }

    /* Styles for section on small screens */
    section {
        padding: 0.5em;
    }

    /* Styles for footer on small screens */
    footer {
        padding: 0.5em;
    }
}

/* Multiple media-queries */
/* In this example, the first media query is checking for screens that have a minimum width of 1200px, when the width of the screen is greater than or equal to 1200px, the background color of the body changes to red.

The second media query is checking for screens that have a minimum width of 700px and a maximum width of 1199px, when the width of the screen is between these two values, the background color of the body changes to green.

The third media query is checking for screens that have a maximum width of 699px, when the width of the screen is less than 700px, the background color of the body changes to blue.
